1) MySQL is a RDBMS (relational database management system) based on the SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. It is used for accessing and managing the records in the table.

2) MySQL database language is based on the SQL queries to access and manage the records of the table.

3) MySQL supports multi-threading that makes it easily scalable.

4) MySQL supports a large number of embedded applications, which makes MySQL very flexible.

5) MySQL is compatible to run on many operating systems, like Windows, Linux, many varieties of UNIX (such as Sun Solaris, AIX) and others. MySQL also provides a facility that the clients can run on the same computer as the server or on another computer (communication via a local network or the Internet).

6) MySQL allows transactions to be rolled back, commit, and crash recovery.

7) Its efficiency is high because it has a very low memory leakage problem.

8) It can download, install, and execute on most of the available operating systems so we can say it MySQL is platform independent.

EXAMPLES:- 

1) Create a employee table:-

    CREATE TABLE employee_table(  
    id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
    name varchar(30) NOT NULL,  
    occupation varchar(30) NOT NULL,  
    age int NOT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);  

2) Insert records into a table

    INSERT INTO employee_table VALUES
    (1, 'Sonu kumar', 'Developer', 24),
    (2, 'Ayush', 'Tester', 22),
    (3, 'Navneet', 'Programmer', 22);

3) Select all records from a table

    SELECT * FROM employee_table;

4) Update record in a table

    UPDATE employee_table
        SET age = 25
        WHERE id = 1;

5) Delete a record from a table

    DELETE FROM employee_table
        WHERE id = 2;

6) Select a single col from a table

    SELECT name FROM employee_table;

7) We can sort the output 

    SELECT *  
    FROM employee_table  
    WHERE age = 22  
    ORDER BY name;  

8) Use like operator

    SELECT * FORM employee_table
    WHERE name LIKE '%vn%';
